		<h1>...What?</h1>
		<h4>What is bubbl.io?</h4>
		<p>Bubbl.io is a file-collaboration service that has no registration mechanism. Think of it as a disposable DropBox.</p>
		<h4>How do I use this...?</h4>
		<p>
			Dragging and dropping a file at the homepage will automatically create a new bubbl for you. From there, you can generate links to give to your collaborators. After 7 days of a link not being used, it disappears. If there are no links associated with a file, the file itself disappears as well.
		</p>
		<h4>So what's a bubbl?</h4>
		<p>A bubbl is the container for your files. Anyone who sees it can edit anything inside of it, so only give links to those who you trust. Bubbls can be of unlimited size, but each file inside of one can only be 25mb or less. It stores any type of file, but some types you'll have to download to edit.</p>
